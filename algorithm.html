    <h1> The stove process</h1>
    <p>What happens when the stove does not work?</p>
    <b>First</b>
    <p> Is it because of the switches?<br>
        Turn it on and let's see how it works.<br>
        If it works, the fire will be on. <br>
        If not, it must be out of the gas.<br>
    </p>

    <b>Second</b>
        <p>If it is out of gas, there are two options.
            You can fix if you know how to do. <br>
            If not, do not kill yourself and call the professional to handle it.<br>
        </p>
